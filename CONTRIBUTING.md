# Getting Started

## Making Changes

* Make sure you have a [Github account](https://github.com/signup/free);
* Fork the project;
* Commit your changes on your branch;
* Push to your fork;
* Optionally submit a issue, if no one exists;
* Submit a PR.

## What must I do?

* Every commit, message and any other content is in English (except translation,
of course), if you are not sure about your English, you can use Portuguese or
any other language, we will be pleased to help you :).
But the final result must be in English;
* If you have access to master never, NEVER, NEVER send a PR and close it by
yourself;
* If you have access to master with a collegue never, NEVER, NEVER send a commit
direct to master, i. e., always submit a PR;
* Code with no tests will not be accepted, if you are not sure about it we also
will be pleased to help you.
